# Wavegen

Interactive tool for .wav file generation.

The point is mostly to study properties of acoustics and harmonics, such as scale dynamics and irrationals in music theory.

run:

```
./wavegen.sh
```

## TODO

* Improve the interface for easier experimentation. Switch to CLI flags rather than interactive.
* Add envelope options. As it is, attack, sustain, and decay have only default values.
* Try more math stuff. Logarithmic pitch changes, etc.
* Add more scales.

## Won't do

* Play audio on the fly. Much simpler just to create files.
* Combine waveforms. The DAW can do that.
