# Wavegen

Interactive tool for .wav file generation.

run:

```
./wavegen.sh
```

## TODO

* Improve the interface for easier experimentation. Just add notes, up/down scale.
* Envelope support: attack, sustain, decay.
* Try more math stuff. Pi, logarithmic forms, etc.

## Won't do

* Play audio on the fly. Much simpler just to create files.
* Combine waveforms. The DAW can do that.
